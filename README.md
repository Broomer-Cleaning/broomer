## Functionality

 -GraphQL
 GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. In GraphQL, there are only two types of operations you can perform: queries and mutations.

-Mutations
 Mutation queries modify data in the data store and returns a value. It can be used to insert, update, or delete data. Mutations are defined as a part of the schema.

-Queries
 A GraphQL operation can either be a read or a write operation. A GraphQL query is used to read or fetch values while a mutation is used to write or post values. In either case, the operation is a simple string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with data in a specific format. The popular response format that is usually used for mobile and web applications is JSON.

-Server-side config (resolvers)
 Server-side resolvers for mutations involve code that changes state in some way.
